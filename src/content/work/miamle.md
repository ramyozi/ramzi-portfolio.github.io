  Miamle is a comprehensive web application developed for managing Spanish-style potluck gatherings. Built using Java EE and MySQL, it allows users to organize, register, and coordinate events, ensuring that everyone brings the right dish and enough portions. The application also offers real-time tracking and warns of potential food shortages.

Miamle was initially designed as a console application and a desktop windowed version, and it's now in the process of being transformed into a web-based platform for enhanced usability and accessibility. This project is a testament to our commitment to facilitating seamless and enjoyable potluck gatherings.

In this project, our key functionalities include:

- Participant Management:

Registering participants with their names, contact information, and the number of accompanying guests.
Providing a space for participants to specify their chosen dish type (appetizer, main course, dessert, beverage) and the quantity they intend to bring.
Allowing participants to include remarks or comments.

- Data Presentation:

Displaying participant information in a user-friendly table format.
Highlighting any potential shortages of specific dish types to aid organizers in making informed decisions.

- Future Expansion:

While our primary focus is on individual Spanish-style potluck gatherings, we envision further expansion into managing multiple events and venues in the future.

Miamle is a work in progress, and we are excited to present our achievements and challenges during the upcoming client presentation. We look forward to demonstrating the progress made in transitioning from console to web-based functionality and discussing our vision for the future.
