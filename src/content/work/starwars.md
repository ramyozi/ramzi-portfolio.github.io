description: |
  In a galaxy far, far away, the Star Wars saga continues, and the Rebel Alliance requires a robust management system for their fighter squadrons. As the developer of this vital application, you'll oversee the allocation of resources, including pilots and spacecraft, for the ultimate battle against the Death Star. Your mission is critical, and this application may be the Rebellion's last hope.

This project, developed by me and 3 of my colleagues in 2023, is a mini-programming assignment that involves creating a web application for the Rebel Alliance to manage their fighter pilots and spacecraft. The application's functionalities include:

Pilot Management:

Registration of aspiring pilots, including their personal information.
Displaying information of all registered pilots.
Viewing specific pilot details based on their ID.
Spacecraft Management:

Addition of new spacecraft, including their type (X-Wing or Y-Wing) and operational status (operational, maintenance, or destroyed).
Displaying information of all spacecraft.
Viewing specific spacecraft details based on their ID.
Modifying the status of a spacecraft based on its ID.
Displaying the number of operational spacecraft and their respective IDs.
Assignment Management:

Assigning a spacecraft to a pilot, with the condition that a pilot can have only one assigned spacecraft, and a spacecraft can be assigned to only one pilot.
Dissociating a pilot from their assigned spacecraft.
All data should be saved for future use. The application must also adhere to specific race requirements for pilot registration, as listed in the annex.

Annex - Pilot Races:
The Rebel Alliance accepts pilot candidates from specific races due to intelligence and spatial constraints. The following races are eligible:

- Chalact√©ens
- Chiss
- Humains

- Thisspasiens
- Togrutas
- Wookies
- Wronians
- Zabraks
- Deliverables:

All deliverables should be compiled into a single ZIP file and deposited in a designated repository:

- Document with use cases
- Screen mockups
- Conceptual data model
- Physical data model
- Database SQL dump
- Link to the Git repository or ZIP containing the entire code (excluding /node_modules).
